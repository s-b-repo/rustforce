==============================
🚀 BRUTEFORCER USAGE GUIDE
==============================

This tool performs concurrent brute-force login attempts on
FTP, SSH, and Telnet services for a list of IP addresses.

-------------
REQUIREMENTS
-------------

1. Rust installed (https://rust-lang.org)
2. Internet (to download dependencies)
3. A folder containing the following files:

   - main.rs
   - ftp.rs
   - ssh.rs
   - telnet.rs

   And the following input files in the **same folder**:

   - usernames.txt      ← List of usernames to try
   - passwords.txt      ← List of passwords to try
   - targets.txt        ← List of IP addresses or hostnames

-----------
DEPENDENCIES
-----------

Install Rust dependencies (only once):

    cargo build

The project uses:
- async-ftp
- ssh2
- telnet
- tokio
- anyhow
- futures

(These will be downloaded automatically during `cargo build`)

-------------
INPUT FORMATS
-------------

• usernames.txt:
    admin
    root
    user
    test

• passwords.txt:
    123456
    password
    toor
    admin123

• targets.txt:
    192.168.0.1
    10.0.0.5
    ftp.example.com

Make sure **each line** contains only one item.

-------------
RUNNING
-------------

Run the tool from the same folder:

    cargo run

--------------
RESULTS
--------------

Results are saved into:

1. `valid_credentials.txt`
    → Full log of every valid username:password found

2. `success.txt`
    → Highlighted summary of successful logins in this format:

       [+] FTP Success: 192.168.0.1 => admin:123456

--------------
PERFORMANCE
--------------

This tool is optimized for speed:

✔ Concurrent scanning of all IPs
✔ FTP, SSH, and Telnet scanned simultaneously
✔ Max 20 login attempts at once per target (safe flood limit)
✔ Each protocol runs tasks in parallel with controlled limits

--------------
TIPS
--------------

✅ Use SecLists for better wordlists:

   Download from: https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists

   Example:
   - usernames.txt → SecLists/Usernames/Default-Credentials
   - passwords.txt → SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials

✅ Use VPNs or network isolation when testing external IPs.

✅ Only test systems you have permission to scan.
